# QuickShutdown
QuickShutdown is a freeware windows utility for instant or delayed restarting, powering down and suspension of your pc. 
Fast session locking and logging off through the QuickShutdown tray menu prevents unauthorized access to your machine when your system is left unattended. 
Delayed functions can be used to, for example, shutdown your computer after a download completes or when it has finished processing video or audio conversions.
